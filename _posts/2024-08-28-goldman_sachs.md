**Student Name:** Samparna Mittra  

**Current Course:** MSQE  

**Degree Before Masters:** B.Sc. Economics (Hons.)  

**Company Name:** Goldman Sachs  
**Job Role:** Summer Analyst (Engineering Dept.)  
**Duration of the Job Role:** 2-3 Month Internship  

**Hiring Process Overview:**  
Submission of CV > Aptitude Test > Shortlisting > 2-3 Interview Rounds

**Questions Asked in Online Aptitude Test (if applicable):**  
Questions were based on probability, puzzles, logical solving and coding. While probability questions were largely approachable (based on Conditional Probability, Bayes Rule, etc.), puzzles (logical and probability-based) were quite tricky and the coding question was very advanced. 

**Number of Interview Rounds:**  
2

**Questions Asked in Round 1:**  
Personal questions: 
- Introduce yourself to me. 
- Why did you undertake this project? Walk me through it. Questions discussing the project. 
- Minor details about academic background (eg: did I have mathematics/statistics in my UG programme.)

Technical questions:
- I have two independent standard normal variables X and Y. Given X>0 and Y<0, find the probability that (X+Y)>0.
- I can climb a flight of stairs as follows: either 1 step at a time or 2 steps at a time. Find out the no. of ways in which I can climb up 'n' steps if the order in which I take a step matters. 
- This generates the Fibonacci sequence. How to code it in a programme (pseudo-code) with maximum efficiency and least complexity?

**Questions Asked in Round 2:**  
Technical question:
There are 2 players A and B with 25 cards in between them. One can either pick up 1 or 2 or 3 cards at a time. The one who picks the last card is the winner. Do you want to go as first or second player? Is there a winning strategy for either player? Do you observe a pattern in this?

**Questions Asked in Further Rounds:**  


**Job Role Experience:**  


**Suggestions for Candidates (including resources, books, websites):**  
I found a few common puzzles from the interviews online, mostly on GeeksForGeeks, so that's a helpful website.
