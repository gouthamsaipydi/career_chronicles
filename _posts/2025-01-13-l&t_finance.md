- What problems did you face when working with the data? How did you deal with missing values in the dataset?

- Where does the Mean outperform the Median as a better descriptive statistic and vice versa?
- What measure did you use to assess your model?
- What were the assumptions of your model (Linear Regression with ridge regularization), and did you check those?
- What is the difference between R^2 and adjusted R^2?

The interviewer then asked about my SQL skills, to which I truthfully admitted that I don't know SQL but am comfortable with pandas.

The subsequent questions included:

- What is the difference between loc and iloc in pandas?
