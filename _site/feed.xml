<p><strong>Degree Before Masters:</strong> BSc Mathematics</p>

<p><strong>Company Name:</strong> PwC<br />
<strong>Job Role:</strong> Technology Consultant<br />
<strong>Duration of the Job Role:</strong> 2-3 Month Internship</p>

<p><strong>Hiring Process Overview:</strong><br />
Direct Interview from Shortlist</p>

<p><strong>Questions Asked in Online Aptitude Test (if applicable):</strong></p>

<p><strong>Number of Interview Rounds:</strong><br />
More than 2</p>

<p><strong>Questions Asked in Round 1:</strong><br />
In the beginning he asked me what do I know about PwC, what does the company do and why do I want to work here.</p>

<p>Then he asked me some questions on programming and how do we use it to clean data.
We talked a bit about my programming journey a what kind of tools I am aware of.</p>

<p>Then I was given two machine learning case studies to analyze and provide desired results:
1) Time Series Forecasting: 
Given data of sales of Amazon in South India for the past 5 years, how would you analyze whether a reputed brand that sells jackets should continue their business in their region or not</p>

<p>2) Regression and Hypothesis Testing:
Given you are an underwriter for an insurance co. and you are given relevant data, how will you analyze the premium that must be charged from a customer</p>

<p>P.S This was the hardest round of the interview and the interviewer only wanted technical answers, so MBA case studies won’t help, try to do some projects in relevant topics and understand them well enough to be able to explain your intuitive approach, both from a programmer’s and statistician’s perspective. No hints were given and I made tons of mistakes, the toughest round I’ve ever been in</p>

<p>In the end, he asked me some personal and off the topic related questions. For example what do I do to improve my skills in my free time, what is my desired career path, etc. He asked if I had any questions, I asked, since he is from a finance position, and I want to venture into the same domain, what kind of steps can I take and projects should I do at this stage.</p>

<p><strong>Questions Asked in Round 2:</strong><br />
This was mainly a personality interview. He asked me about my knowledge in Current Affairs and I said I’m mainly interested in Politics and Economics. He asked about my views on US elections where Trump recently won and kept checking my depth on this topic by asking questions (mainly economics/trade related questions). Then he asked about socialism and capitalism with respect to how things are run in India compared to US, and why India cannot take off like other countries in terms of manufacturing. This section was 20 minutes and was much more smooth sailing than Round 1 and the interviewer was friendly.</p>

<p>Next he asked some personal questions like what is my main drive in life and how do I deal with failure and depression. Then some career related questions like what do you do to improve your skills as a data scientist, which one do you enjoy: data or analysis, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Questions Asked in Further Rounds:</strong><br />
HR Round: Personal questions about my daily life, hobbies.
Few I can remember are:
Verbally define the favorite photograph you’ve taken in your life (as photography was mentioned in my hobbies)
If a friend visits Kolkata, where would you take him/her?
Difference between South and North Kolkata and which one do you prefer?</p>

Internship not commenced yet</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions for Candidates (including resources, books, websites):</strong><br />
Do machine learning projects. No need to do advance projects, just understand every step in the project carefully with an intuitive approach</p>

Asked some questions about family and education background.</p>

<p>Why did you join MSQE after a Masters in Physics?</p>

<p>Why are you interested in Statistics? (I had mentioned interest in Statistics when they asked about why I joined ISI).</p>

<p>Generally people with taller height can see more, but I am saying that people with shorter heights can see more (with tall and short people on the same platform), comment on it
(the answer was selection bias in hypothesis testing)</p>

<p>Asked me to sell a water bottle to them (they wanted to guage the thought process, approach and thinking capacity of the candidate and expected candidates to ask them questions before pitching the product, if you do not ask them questions they would likely reject you)</p>

<p>Will you prefer taking 10 crores right now or 1 lakh every month if given the choice? What factors are affecting your choice?</p>

<p>What are you going to do if you find that your dataset is imbalanced? Asked about insampling and out of sample techniques.</p>

<p>RBI has currently set very high interest rates, comment on it from the perspective of global economy (I answered that inflation is high in USA right now so their central bank has put high interest rates to combat inflation, meanwhile growth in India is very good despite global recession. If RBI decreases interest rates then international investors might take money out of India and put in USA to earn higher interest which might hamper India’s growth)</p>

<p>Asked me questions about anime (I had mentioned watching anime as hobby in CV, interviewer possessed domain knowledge and asked me quite a few good questions for which I had to think)</p>

<p>If you have to give a presentation to investors and you find a mistake in the code which is forecasting the same expected growth that investors want to hear, what will you do about that mistake? Especially when there is not a lot of time left before presentation.</p>
